## App Exercise - Fitness Tracker: Constant or Variable?
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 There are all sorts of things that a fitness tracking app needs to keep track of in order to display the right information to the user. Similar to the last exercise, declare either a constant or a variable for each of the following items, and assign each a sensible value. Be sure to use proper naming conventions.
 
- Name: The user's name
- Age: The user's age
- Number of steps taken today: The number of steps that a user has taken today
- Goal number of steps: The user's goal for number of steps to take each day
- Average heart rate: The user's average heart rate over the last 24 hours
 */
var Name = "Caleb" // I chose to make Name a variable becasue your name can be legaly changed
var Age = 20 // Age is a variable becasue your age changes every year
var StepsToday = 2000 // StepsToday is a variable because it is constantly changing throughout the day
let Goal = 10000 // Goal is a constant becasue it is a static number that you are reaching towards
var Heart = 87 // Heart is a variable because your average heart rate will change over 24 hours
/*:
 Now go back and add a line after each constant or variable declaration. On those lines, print a statement explaining why you chose to declare the piece of information as a constant or variable.
