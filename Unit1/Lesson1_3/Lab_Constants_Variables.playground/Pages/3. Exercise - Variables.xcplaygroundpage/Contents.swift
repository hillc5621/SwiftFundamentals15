var schooling = 2
print(schooling)
//:  Now imagine you just completed an additional year of school, and update the `schooling` variable accordingly. Print `schooling` to the console.
schooling = 3
print(schooling)
//:  Does the above code compile? Why is this different than trying to update a constant? Print your explanation to the console using the `print` function.
print("it compiles properly becasue a variable is alowed to change where as a constant is not alowed to change.")
